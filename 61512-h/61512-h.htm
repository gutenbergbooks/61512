  <h2 class='c004'>FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>This book has been written to tell
little girls how much fun it is to
learn to sew and make pretty things for their
dolls, themselves, and other people. Of
course, as Sir Bodkin says, “We can’t have
gains without pains,” but it is much pleasanter
to learn in play how to do things the
right way. This makes it easier for us when
we are grown up, because we have the
knowledge “at our finger-tips.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I hope that mothers, teachers, and those
interested in girls will find this book helpful,
as my experience has been that children
eagerly grasp and absorb facts presented in
story and rhyme.</p>

<p class='c006'>A number of these sewing-lesson stories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>have appeared in the <cite>Modern Priscilla Magazine</cite>.

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER I  <span class='large'>THE KING OF THE ONE-EYED FAIRIES</span></h2>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_015.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret Allen had just had a
birthday. Her auntie had given her
a pretty new work-basket for a present. It
was lined with pink silk and in it was the
dearest little needle-book
of pink satin,
an emery-bag shaped
like a strawberry, a
cunning pair of steel
scissors, a silver thimble,
several spools of black thread and white
thread of different numbers, a tape measure,
and beeswax shaped like a tiny lemon.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
<img src='images/i_016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t it just too sweet for anything!”
cried Margaret clapping her hands with delight.
“Now if there really were fairies to
help us, just as in the story-books, what lots
of things I could make. If I knew how I
could make clothes
for my doll, pretty
things for Mother and
Auntie, and marble-bags
for Jim. Oh!”
she cried out of breath, “I just wish I knew
how!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Suddenly she felt funny sharp pricks on her
hands and arms. Looking down she saw a
line of little shining figures, some short and
some tall, come dancing and prancing out of
her new work-basket. Some had big eyes and
some tiny-teensy eyes but each had only one,
however. They looked so comical dancing on
their skinny legs and waving their skinny arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>that Margaret wanted to laugh. Their thin
bodies shone and glistened in the sunshine as
they skipped across her lap and up on the table
beside her. Then they sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You can do it! You can do it!</div>
      <div class='line'>We can always help you sew it!</div>
      <div class='line'>With a piece of thread for harness</div>
      <div class='line'>And your thimble bright to push us!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! Oh!” cried Margaret her eyes very
wide open indeed, “can you really? Who are
you?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then out of the line stepped the largest one
of all. He placed his hand on his heart and
made a very low bow before her and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>“How do you do, My Lady,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ve come at your command.</div>
      <div class='line'>You wished the help of fairies,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re the One-Eyed Fairy Band.</div>
      <div class='line'>We hide inside your basket,</div>
      <div class='line'>And keep so very still,</div>
      <div class='line'>Until you call upon us,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then we’ll help you with a will.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_018.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How wonderful! Thank you!” cried
Margaret eagerly. “What is your name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I am Sir Bodkin. Some call
me Tape Needle. Anyway, I’m
King of the One-Eyes,” he answered
proudly. “I’m the largest
of all and not needed so often to
help. There are many fine workers
among us, I can tell you. Just say
the word and we’ll show you what
we can do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m so glad,” said Margaret, “for there
are lots of things I want to learn how to
make.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The Fairies danced faster and faster in their
joy at finding such a dear little girl for a
friend and mistress. They sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When needlecraft you’d like to know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Just call on us to help you sew.</div>
      <div class='line'>Our stitching steps we love to do,</div>
      <div class='line'>So let us show them all to you.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_019.jpg' alt='“You can do it! You can do it! We can always help you sew it.”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, kind Fairies,” cried Margaret.
“I’m so happy. Won’t Mother be surprised!
I’m just crazy to begin!”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>All the Fairies waited breathlessly to know
who would be the first to show Margaret
what he could do.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your Ladyship, it is fitting that the King
should be the first to show what he can do,”
said Sir Bodkin standing very stiff and
straight.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, of course,” replied Margaret and was
about to ask him to tell her what he could do
when she heard her mother’s voice outside
her door, calling to her. The Fairies sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Stick to us, stick to us,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then you’ll never, never fuss.</div>
      <div class='line'>Good-bye, good-bye, we must away,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll come again another day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They slipped quickly off the table and hid
in the work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>The King waited until the last one was out
of sight then he said with a bow, “We’re
very glad to know you, My Lady. Just call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>my name when you need help.” Then he,
too, slipped away from off the table and into
the work-basket.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_021.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Aren’t they just too funny and dear!”
laughed Margaret to herself as she put the
work-basket on her table and ran off to answer
her mother. “Now I must think up something
nice to make for my doll,” she said to

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Sir Bodkin! Sir Bodkin!” called
Margaret next day to the King of the
One-Eyed Fairies, who lived in her work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m coming, My
Lady!” she heard a tiny
voice answering from
the needle-book.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret looked very
much excited, for this
was the first time she
had called her wonderful
new friends, the One-Eyed Fairies, to
help her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin came sliding quickly out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>work-basket and climbed upon the table beside
his little mistress. With a smile on her
face she was watching him, for he was a very
dignified little fellow indeed. Holding himself
up straight and bending his body forward
stiffly he made her a low bow.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good day, My Lady Dear,” he said;
“what may I do to-day to help your Ladyship?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can you do?” asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can run the ribbons in your doll’s
dresses, put the drawing-strings in a marble-bag
or a sewing-bag. I can draw the ribbons
and tapes through your pretty underwear and
lots of other things too numerous to mention.
Just put a piece of ribbon in my one eye and
watch me work!” he answered eagerly to his
new friend.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed I will this minute!” cried Margaret.
She jumped up and ran to her doll’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>bureau to get a pretty dress trimmed with
lace beading around the waist and sleeves.
Then she took a roll of narrow pink satin
ribbon from her own bureau and hurried back
to the table.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_024.jpg' alt='She ran to her doll’s bureau to get a pretty dress' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Here we are,” she said to the tiny King,
holding up the dress and ribbon for him to
see.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>
<img src='images/i_025.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Very pretty, very pretty. Now measure
how much ribbon you’ll need to run around
the waist and to tie in a bow at the back when
finished,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Margaret had measured the ribbon
the right length she cut it
from the roll with her new
scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Put it neatly in my
eye and then we’ll start,”
the Fairy King told her.
No sooner said than done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Put your right fingers
on my head,” ordered he. Margaret did
as she was bidden. Holding the dress in her
left hand, she put her pink fingers on Sir
Bodkin’s head and off he stepped; slipping
his foot through the slits in the lace beading
at the back of the little dress where it fastened
he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>“In and out, in and out,</div>
      <div class='line'>I hold the ribbon nice and flat,</div>
      <div class='line'>I gently pull it after me,</div>
      <div class='line'>And soon we’re finished, one, two, three!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_026.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Running ribbon in beading</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin hopped out at the end.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How’s that for fast?” he said jumping
back to the table-top.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s splendid!” cried Margaret. Then
she cut the ribbon for the sleeves after carefully
measuring how much was needed to go
around the beading and tie in a bow when
finished. Each piece was put in the King’s
eye one at a time and run through the lace
beading nice and flat. Sir Bodkin’s blunt
toe made it easy to go in and out the openings
without catching in the lace. At last the
ribbon was all in and the dress slipped on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>doll. The tiny King stood off to see how
sweet she looked in her dainty dress after her
little mother had tied the bows.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I never did that so quickly before,” said
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all in knowing how,” replied Sir
Bodkin looking very wise indeed out of his
long one eye.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_027.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“To be sure,” said his little mistress, “and
I’m so happy because soon I’m going to
know how to sew and make lots of pretty
things.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed you are, My Lady,” said Sir
Bodkin; “just call on us and you’ll always
find us ready. But don’t forget that:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll remember that,” Margaret
promised. “Oh! Sir
Bodkin, look at all your subjects!”
she said laughing.
The King turned around and
saw all the shining, glinting
little One-Eyed Fairies peeping
out curiously from the
work-basket.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>

</div>

<p class='c011'>they were singing in a happy chorus.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To your places!” ordered their King and
they all disappeared. Then he made a low
bow to Margaret and slipped away into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>work-basket. Margaret laughed happily and
ran off to show her mother what Sir Bodkin
had helped her to do.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_030.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret held up the little doll’s
dress her mother had cut out for her
to make.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wish that the One-Eyed Fairies would
come and help me
sew it together,” she
said to her doll. She
then took her work-basket
and sat down
by the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin,” she
softly called.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here I am, My
Lady,” she heard Sir
Bodkin’s tiny voice answer from the needle-book
in the work-basket. In a second the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>King of the One-Eyed Fairies hopped out of
the basket and right up on the table beside
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What can we do for you to-day, My
Lady?” he asked bowing low.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would like to sew my doll’s dress. Will
you show me how?” replied Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That I will. Come all you Stitchers!”
he cried as loud as he could.</p>

<p class='c006'>Out of the work-basket came a line of One-Eyed
Fairies; some tall and thin, some short
and fat. They danced on Margaret’s table,
holding hands and singing this song in their
comical way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, we can baste and we can run,</div>
      <div class='line'>And we can overcast.</div>
      <div class='line'>We hem and gather, fell and tuck,</div>
      <div class='line'>We all work very fast.</div>
      <div class='line'>Please have the thread the proper length,</div>
      <div class='line'>And just the proper number,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then if you keep us shining bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>We’ll work and never slumber.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Well done, my hearties!” cried Sir Bodkin
proudly. “Now, Baster, you jolly rogue,
show her how to baste the seams.”</p>

<p class='c006'>From the line a large One-Eyed Fairy
stepped out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some thread in my eye and we’ll start,”
he said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_032.jpg' alt='From the tip of her nose to the end of her arm' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Remember the proper length,” said
Baster, as Margaret took up the spool of
basting-thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the tip of her nose to the end of her
arm, Sir Bodkin said was the proper length.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>When Margaret had measured the basting-thread
she cut it from the spool with her
scissors.</p>

<div  class='figright id007'>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='Threading needle' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Thread with the end that leaves the spool
last,” the King told her, “then it will not
snarl and knot so.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret held the cut end between her left
forefinger and thumb and twisted it into a
point with her right
forefinger and thumb.
Then she took Baster
in her right fingers and
put the thread through
his big eye. Pulling
it through about one-third she made a knot
in the other end by twisting it around her
left thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now he’s harnessed and ready to begin,”
said Sir Bodkin. He told Margaret to put
her silver thimble on the middle-finger of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>right hand and push Baster, while her thumb
and forefinger held him round the waist.
Baster then hopped on the seam one-half inch
from the edge. He took quick long steps
singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Ha, ha, ho, ho, I’m gay and free,</div>
      <div class='line'>Basting is the sport for me.</div>
      <div class='line'>With skip and slide I hurry on,</div>
      <div class='line'>My work is short, just like my song.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

<div class='ic006'>
<p>Basting</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Both seams of the simple dress were soon
basted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, Runner,” said Sir Bodkin, as Baster
slid back to his place on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret harnessed Runner, a medium-sized
One-Eyed Fairy with a small eye, using
number 60 thread, the proper length and the
same color as the dress, but no knot this time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>Runner took tiny running steps right in
Baster’s tracks. But before she began to run
she took three back steps, where the seam
began, to fasten the thread. She sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I run along, neat and fast,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sew the seam so it will last.</div>
      <div class='line'>In and out the thread goes, too,</div>
      <div class='line'>The fastening holds it firm and true!</div>
      <div class='line'>Now take three back steps at the end</div>
      <div class='line'>So it will not rip out, my friend.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Running</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>First one seam then the other was stitched,
after which Margaret snipped the thread and
Runner danced back to her place on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>All the One-Eyed Fairies stood in a stiff
line.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must be tired standing so long,” said
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are,” said their King. “It would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>pleasant if we had a pincushion to rest ourselves
in.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The very thing!” cried Margaret. “I’ll
get the pretty tomato pincushion Mother
gave me the other day for my work-basket.”
She ran eagerly out of the room and soon
returned with a pincushion
in her hand that looked just
like a red ripe tomato.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now you can rest,” she
said placing it on the table.
In a jiffy all the tired little
One-Eyed Fairy Stitchers
had stuck their sharp little
toes down deep into the tomato
pincushion. Then they
stood up very straight, harnessed, ready and
waiting until their turns came to help.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is better,” said Sir Bodkin with a
sigh of relief. “We can stay here until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>work is done, for we don’t have to go
back to the needle-book every time. We
can wait outside until the piece of work is
finished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I can put the pincushion in the work-basket
when we’re through at night, so you’ll
be in your own house,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That will be delightful,” said Sir Bodkin;
“thank you, My Lady. Shall we do the
hem to-day?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_037.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I think not to-day for I must go and study
my lessons now. To-morrow we’ll finish the
dress,” said his little mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very good,” replied Sir Bodkin. “Just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>fold your work up neatly and lay it in the
work-basket on top of us.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you all so much,” said Margaret
to the One-Eyed Fairies as she placed the
pincushion in the work-basket and laid the
doll’s dress, neatly folded, on top.</p>

<p class='c006'>The One-Eyed Fairies nestled down in the
red tomato pincushion very comfortably and
waited for to-morrow to come so they could
show their little mistress how to hem the
pretty dress she was making for her doll.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Next day Margaret ran happily home
from school. She put her books, hat
and coat in the closet and then rushed up to
her room to finish her doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Goody me, such
dirty hands! I must
go to the bathroom
and give them a
good scrubbing with
soap and water before
I touch my
work,” she said importantly
to Sir Bodkin, who sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Clean white fingers,</div>
      <div class='line'>Needles shining bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Will help the sewing,</div>
      <div class='line'>To go along just right.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Sir Bodkin,” she said to him, when her
hands were clean and dainty again, “I hope
you and the One-Eyes enjoyed your rest in
the pincushion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed we did, My Lady, thanks to you,”
he replied as Margaret lifted the red tomato
pincushion, in which they were sticking, out
of the work-basket and placed it on her table.
He then stepped on the table-top ready to
direct the hemming of the doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All ready, My Lady?” he asked eager to
begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” replied Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before we begin, have you any pins, My
Lady?” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Only a few in my pincushion on my
bureau,” replied Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We better have plenty, because they will
be needed from time to time as we do our
work,” the tiny King told her.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Very well, I’ll ask Mother for some more,”
said Margaret and went out of the room to
her mother’s sewing-room. When she came
back she had a whole paper of pins in her
hand.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_041.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the ticket,” said Sir Bodkin; “take
some out and stick them in the red tomato
with my boys and girls.” Then he directed
as follows:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Slip the dress on your doll and mark with
pins how long it should be when finished.
Then slip it off and baste along the hem edge
to hold it firm.” Then Sir Bodkin told Margaret
to get out her tape measure and measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>the width of the hem from the edge of the
dress to the top of the hem to be sure it
was even all around.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Trim off with your scissors where it is
too deep,” Sir Bodkin said, and Margaret
followed his directions.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now turn in the hem top one-quarter inch
and crease it with your nail or pleat it with
your fingers, then baste it to the dress,” the
King said and with hop, skip, and jump that
jolly fellow Baster did his work.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin then called Hemmer, a dainty
little One-Eyed Fairy. Margaret was about
to harness her with the same thread she had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>used for Runner but it wouldn’t go into her
eye.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_043.jpg' alt='“Mark with pins how long it should be when finished”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“It’s not the proper number,” said Sir
Bodkin. Margaret tried some finer thread,
number 80.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s better,” she said as it slipped
easily through Hemmer’s little eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>After taking two back steps on the edge of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the hem to fasten the thread, Hemmer began
to step daintily along, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“First through the dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then through the hem,</div>
      <div class='line'>And now we do it all over again.</div>
      <div class='line'>Stitches must not on the right side show,</div>
      <div class='line'>So put me through lightly as onward we go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='ic006'>
<p>Hemming</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I love hemming!” cried Margaret as
Hemmer slipped through the dress and then
through the hem edge with Margaret’s little
pink thumb and forefinger holding her, and
her silver thimble on her middle-finger pushing
her. Margaret’s left hand was holding the
hem.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Goody me, it’s all sewed!” cried Margaret
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>when the thread was fastened at the end and
snipped off with the scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now turn over the tiny hems one-eighth
inch on the wrong side around the neck and
sleeves and down the slit in the back and
crease them,” ordered Sir Bodkin. “Then
turn one-quarter inch over all around again
for width of the hems. Press them flat as
you go along,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret did this, creasing one turn then
the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come, Baster!” called Sir Bodkin and
soon he had all these tiny hems basted along
their tops so Hemmer could come after him
and finish them with her dainty steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>When all the hems were finished and threads
fastened, Sir Bodkin cried, “Pull out your
bastings and be careful when you do it!”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret laughed to herself to hear him
order her around.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>
<img src='images/i_046.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How shall I fasten the dress on my doll?”
she then asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Suppose you trim it first, then we’ll
decide,” said the King. “How would you
like some kind of bright-colored hand-stitching
around neck and sleeves?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, that would be lovely!” cried his little
mistress, “but I’ll have to do that another
day for I want to run
out and play a while in
the yard now.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin and all
the One-Eyed Fairy
Stitchers sat up very
stiff and straight in the
red tomato pincushion
as Margaret picked it
up and put it in her work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you all so much,” she said to them.
On her way out to play she showed her mother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>how much she and the One-Eyes had done on
her doll’s dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-morrow we’ll trim it and put on the
fastenings,” she said happily.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret had finished her doll’s
dress as far as the plain sewing and
was now ready to call Sir Bodkin to help her
trim it with fancy stitching.</p>

<p class='c006'>She took from her work-basket the pincushion,
where they all were resting, and
softly called his name
as she placed it on
her table. The King
stepped out, made a
very low bow and
climbed up to Margaret’s hand and stood
there.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here I am right on the job,” he said
proudly. “What are your commands for
to-day, My Lady Dear?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t you remember you were to tell

<p class='c006'>“To be sure. That I will gladly,” he
answered. “All out, everybody!” he then
called to his subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>The One-Eyed Fairies rushed out pell-mell,
some from the needle-book and
others from the pincushion. They
all met on the table-top and danced
joyfully, then stood in a straight
line, waiting for orders. Sir Bodkin,
from his perch on Margaret’s hand,
looked them over to see which one
should be called to help.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come here, you Crewel One,”
the King called. A very big-eyed fairy
with a sharp toe stepped forward.</p>

<p class='c006'>“He’s not really cruel, My Lady, just a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>fancy-acting fellow. He’s an artist,” Sir
Bodkin explained to his mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tell, sir, what you can do to make the
world beautiful!” he then said to Crewel, who
began to sing this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I weave the woolen threads so bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>And silk and cotton, too.</div>
      <div class='line'>All in and out and ’round about</div>
      <div class='line'>To make the pattern true;</div>
      <div class='line'>A pretty trimming on your dress,</div>
      <div class='line'>Your rompers or your smock,</div>
      <div class='line'>I also make the blanket-stitch</div>
      <div class='line'>For edging ’round your frock.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the very thing for this dress!” exclaimed
Margaret clapping her hands. “Oh,
let’s begin, dear Crewel. I’ve some lovely
pink wool thread here in my knitting-bag.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She cut a length of the yarn and Sir Bodkin
showed her how to loop it around Crewel’s
head and then squeeze it between her thumb
and forefinger so it would slip easily into his
big eye. Crewel stepped on the back of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>dress at the left side of the neck. He took
two tiny back steps on the wrong side to
fasten the thread. Margaret held the edge
of the neckline over her left forefinger and
held the thread down with her left thumb, so
Crewel could slip over it when making the
blanket-stitch. He then sang as they worked:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Back from the edge</div>
      <div class='line'>I step in, you know,</div>
      <div class='line'>Towards you, ’neath the edge,</div>
      <div class='line'>I stick out my toe.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then I slide o’er the thread</div>
      <div class='line'>You are holding for me;</div>
      <div class='line'>Blanket-stitching is pretty,</div>
      <div class='line'>Quite easy, you see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_051.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Blanket-stitch</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They stitched from left to right, all around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>the neckline of the dress, fastening the thread
securely at the end. Then stitched around
each sleeve edge in turn the same way. The
blanket-stitches made a pretty finish to hold
the hems around the neck and sleeves and
also made a nice firm edge.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was great fun holding the thread while
Crewel jumped through the cloth, stuck his
toe out under the edge and over the thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s just like jumping rope,” said Margaret,
“and how fast it goes, too!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have to be careful to take even
jumps from one stitch to the other,” said the
King, “or it won’t look so pretty. If you
wish, My Lady, you can make a different
pattern by varying the length of the stitches.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s been great fun. Now my doll’s dress
is trimmed. Thank you so much, dear
Crewel,” said Margaret as she snipped the
last thread.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>
<img src='images/i_053.jpg' alt='“Blanket-stitching is pretty Quite easy you see”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>That graceful fellow bowed and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“You’re very welcome, Lady Dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis fun for me, you know;</div>
      <div class='line'>And while I’m skipping in and out,</div>
      <div class='line'>You’re learning how to sew!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_054.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin looked very happy and very
proud of his artistic subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Crewel One stepped to the table and
into the tomato pincushion. In
his eye was hanging some of the
pink wool thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To fasten your doll’s dress
at the back, I would suggest
that you use ties of ribbon or of the wool
thread,” said Sir Bodkin. “Which do you
prefer, My Lady?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think tie-strings of the wool thread
would be pretty,” replied Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then cut two lengths, long enough to tie
in a bow, and fasten an end of each to each
side of the neck at the back,” Sir Bodkin said.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>
<img src='images/i_055.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret measured the thread, put each
strand separately in Crewel’s eye, then he
sewed each piece securely to
the dress. Margaret slipped
the finished dress on her
doll, tied the strings, and
held her up to be admired.</p>

<p class='c006'>The little One-Eyed Fairies
looked very much pleased.
Margaret thanked them and
pulled all the threads out of their eyes so
they could rest better in the needle-book,
in the work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>When they were out of sight, Sir Bodkin,
too, waved a fond farewell and disappeared.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Ouch! my knee. Such a spill! Oh!
look, too, at the big hole in my
stocking!” cried Margaret limping in from
school one day. “Whatever
shall I do to mend it?”</p>

<p class='c006'>On the table beside her
stood her work-basket. Margaret
just naturally looked
that way for help. She knew
where she could find it when
in trouble.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sure enough, in a second,
she saw her little friend, Sir
Bodkin, come hopping quickly
out of the basket.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>“Well, well, in trouble I see,” he said to
Margaret, who looked very unhappy indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! you cunning man! I know I never
could do without you and your Fairies!” she
cried, now smiling and looking so relieved.
“Maybe you can help me?”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_057.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed we can. You need a doctor here
to make some repairs, I’m
thinking,” he said wisely.
Then he went over to the
work-basket and called in a
loud voice:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doctor Darner! How
about a little help here!”</p>

<p class='c006'>From the work-basket came
the sound of scrambling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just so, just so,” replied a
gruff voice as a large One-Eyed Fairy came
hustling and bustling out of the work-basket
and up to Sir Bodkin and Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“Take a good look and give us your advice,”
said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>Doctor Darner looked very carefully at
the torn stocking Margaret held in her
hand.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Two strands of black darning cotton,
please,” he said.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i_058.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Running around the hole</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret got some out of the work-basket
and cut off a length. She squeezed the
thread the same way as
she had the wool for
Crewel so the loop would
slip easily in Doctor
Darner’s eye. Then she
put her fingers on him
and he began to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hold the stocking stretched on your hand,</div>

      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Up and down, across the hole we go;</div>
      <div class='line'>Run, jump, run, row after row.</div>
      <div class='line'>From side to side run, weave, run,</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<img src='images/i_059.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Darning up and down</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Old Doctor Darner and Margaret worked
very busily to fill in the great hole in her
stocking. When it was mended, he took a
little rest in the pincushion for a minute.
Then he turned to her and said,
looking very wise, indeed:</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some day, you will learn
how to mend other rips, tears,
and holes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” cried Margaret, laughing;
“that will be fine ’cause
Mother says I seem always to
be needing a dose of thread and needle.”
She then tested the darn in her stocking by
pulling it this way and that to see if the
stitches were close enough together, just as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Doctor Darner told her to do. It seemed all
right.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i_060.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Darning across</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now your, stocking’s as good as new,”
said he, bowing very low.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you so very much,” said Margaret
truly grateful. Then
he hurried away to
his place in the needle-book.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Isn’t he a nice
old fellow?” said Margaret
to Sir Bodkin when Doctor Darner had
gone.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed he is, even if he is a little gruff in
his manner at times,” replied the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother always wanted me to learn how
to mend my stockings and I never would.
Now she’ll be so pleased when I show this
one to her mended instead of torn. Mothers
have a lot of unpleasant things to look at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>sometimes, don’t they?” she asked the tiny
King, who was walking up and down the
table-top in a very kingly manner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Indeed they do, My Lady,” he replied,
“but I don’t think your mother will
have as many now as she had before you
met us.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_061.jpg' alt='“Hold the stocking stretched on your hand”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“That’s so. I mean to ask her to let me
try to darn one of her stockings and one of
Father’s socks, soon. But I am afraid it will
be a long time before I want to try one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Brother’s. He does get the worst holes in
his that I ever saw!” she said shaking her
head.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Boys are that way and have been ever
since I can remember. But just make up
your mind some day to try one of his and I
am sure you’ll find it easier than you expected.”
Sir Bodkin smiled wisely at his
little mistress. He knew boys, but he also
knew that Margaret was a very brave little
girl who wouldn’t let a big hole in a stocking
frighten her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, Sir Bodkin. I won’t forget
what you say. I’ll run off now and show
Mother how smart I’ve been,” she said as she
limped out of the room. In a second Sir
Bodkin heard her running along the hall just
as usual.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Her knee is mended, too,” he said smiling
to himself. Then he took a good look around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>to see if everything in the work-basket was in
order.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s time we all had an emery plunge,” he
was saying to himself as he slipped quietly
into the basket.</p>

</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_064.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>One day in early spring
Margaret was making
up her doll’s bed with its clean
white sheets and pillow-slips.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dear child, it seems to me
you are not warm enough this
weather. You should have a
warm blanket to sleep under.
I’ll ask Mother for
something to make
one,” she said. Smiling
fondly at her
child, Margaret went to see what her mother
might have in her piece-box that could be
used to make a tiny blanket.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Now Margaret’s mother was a very wonderful
woman. She never turned her little girl
away empty-handed when she came asking
for something to make her play more interesting.
As it happened, there was in her
piece-box a piece of lovely white flannel just
large enough for a doll’s blanket. She gave
it to Margaret to use. Skipping happily
away the small mother came back to her own
room and showed it to her doll-child.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_065.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“This will make you a pretty blanket,”
she said. Then she turned to her work-basket
and called, “Sir Bodkin! Please bring
out the One-Eyed Fairies!”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>
<img src='images/i_066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes! Yes! My Lady!” he answered
sliding quickly out of the basket. “You
now know all of us; which shall it be to-day?”
All the other shining Fairies were
following him. They danced and pranced
out of the needle-book very happy to be
called.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Baster, first,” said Margaret importantly.
“I’m making a blanket for my doll’s bed and
I want to baste the hem at the top and the
one at the bottom. Then perhaps you will
tell me the best way to sew them to stay.”
Sir Bodkin leaned far over
the edge of the table to
get a better look at the
tiny blanket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is it the right length
and width for the bed?”
he asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes. I measured that before I called
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>you,” she answered, harnessing Baster with
basting-thread.</p>

<div  class='figright id008'>
<img src='images/i_067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Catch-stitch</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Very good. You do not need to turn the
hems down but once. Flannel will not ravel
much if quickly held by catch-stitching,”
said he.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret and Baster soon had
the hems basted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is ‘catch-stitching’?”
Margaret asked Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A stitch used to hold a hem
down flat and keep the goods
from ravelling. You can also use
it for a trimming sometime, if
want to. You’ll need the
Crewel One to help you do this stitching.
He’ll show you how. It’s very easy and
pretty,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Crewel One stepped forward and asked
for some wool floss in his eye. “Either pink,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>blue, or red will do to use for catch-stitching,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret cut some pink floss the proper
length and squeezed a tiny loop to put in his
eye. When harnessed, he told Margaret to
hold the hem over her left forefinger. She
took him in her right fingers. He stepped to
the hem and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Coming towards you as I step</div>
      <div class='line'>Away from you I hop.</div>
      <div class='line'>First on the blanket, then the hem,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go backward, do not stop.</div>
      <div class='line'>Evenly I step along</div>
      <div class='line'>And leave a crisscross track,</div>
      <div class='line'>Which catches fast the blanket hem,</div>
      <div class='line'>To do this is a knack.</div>
      <div class='line'>Be sure to fasten tight the floss</div>
      <div class='line'>At both the ends, my dear,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or when it’s put into the wash</div>
      <div class='line'>It might come out, I fear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>They worked busily along each hem.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>
<img src='images/i_069.jpg' alt='“I’ll put you to sleep in your little bed”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! how pretty and easy!” cried Margaret
when the little blanket was finished.
“How sweet the pink stitches look on the
white flannel at each end.” Then she said
to her doll, “Come to me, dear, and I’ll put
you to sleep in your little bed underneath
your pretty, warm, new blanket.” She was
so busy tucking in her doll and singing her to
sleep that she did not thank Sir Bodkin and
the One-Eyed Fairies or notice what they were
doing. With a hop, a skip, and a jump each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>one was having a wonderful time taking a
pleasant plunge foot first through the emery
strawberry.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“We must scrape off our dullness and
brighten ourselves a bit,”
said their King standing
by to see that every one
got a turn. Then, in the
firelight, they danced and
pranced to their hearts’
content on Margaret’s table, to show how
glistening and shining they were again. Soon
to their needle-book bed they all slipped
away for a good night’s sleep.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_071.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Sir Bodkin!” called Margaret one
warm spring day. The One-Eyed
Fairies had been having a long rest in their
home. They were very glad
to hear Margaret’s voice
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She wants us!” they cried
excitedly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush!” commanded their
King, “she wants me. Everybody
wait until I see who is
needed to-day.” He hopped
so quickly out of the work-basket
that he fell headlong to the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Goody me!” cried Margaret picking him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>up and sticking him in the red tomato pincushion.
“Are you hurt?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh no! that’s nothing. One of the chief
sports of our band is floor-falling. We love
to slip to the floor so we can be picked up.
It’s very good for your waist-line,” said Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret laughed. “You’re a funny man,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Did you want me for anything to-day,
My Lady?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I wanted to make a good strong bag
for Jim’s marbles. They’re always falling
out of his pockets and rolling all over the floor
for us to step on. We nearly break our
necks,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, upon my word, that’s a shame.
However we’ll soon remedy that. Get a
piece of heavy, strong cloth, like denim or
gingham. Be sure it’s a dark color, blue or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>brown or green, so it won’t show the dirt, and
we’ll start,” he said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_073.jpg' alt='“Fold the goods lengthwise and cut”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>So Margaret hunted through her mother’s
piece-box again until she found some cloth
that suited her purpose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here we are!” she exclaimed to Sir
Bodkin, as she came back to the room.
Taking her little steel scissors out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>basket she made ready to cut the cloth as she
was directed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the thing; blue denim makes excellent
marble-bags. You can make sewing-bags
of cretonne or silk and laundry-bags of
chintz or linen, but marble-bags must be of
very tough cloth. All bags are about the
same when it comes to the way of making.
It’s just good, strong seams with no raw
edges showing, a proper casing for the
drawing-strings, and the right kind of openings
to pull the strings through. The bags differ
only in size and shape. Now for this bag,
fold the goods lengthwise, and cut it six
inches wide and seven inches long,” Sir Bodkin
told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now, Baster,” said he, “come out for
your harness and step along the seam at the
bottom and up the side, on the right side of
the bag, keeping one-quarter inch from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>edge.” Baster stepped quickly across the
bottom, around the corner and up one side.</p>

<div class='section'>

<div  class='figleft id009'>
<img src='images/i_075a.jpg' alt='Basting and running on outside of bag' class='ig001' />
</div>

</div>

<div class='section'>

<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/i_075b.jpg' alt='Basting and back-stitching on inside of bag' class='ig001' />
</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“The fold makes the other side,” explained
Sir Bodkin. “Now we’ll need a stout Stitcher
for finishing the seams of this heavy material.”
So he called out all the Stitchers and selected
one with a large eye. Margaret harnessed
him with blue cotton thread, then they were
ready to sew the seam.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Run along the seam, across the bottom,
around the corner and up one side a little less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>than one-quarter inch from the edge beside
the basting. Take tiny steps close together,”
he said, “and fasten the thread well at beginning
and ending.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When this was done and Baster and Large
Runner were resting in the pincushion on the
table, Margaret pulled out the bastings and
turned the little bag wrong side out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Run your finger all along the seam inside
to push it well out to the sewing. Now baste
the seam a little more than a quarter inch
from the edge, so there will be no raw edges
showing on the finished felled seam,” the
King said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Is this a felled seam?” Margaret asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, it is a French fell,” Sir Bodkin
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the seam was basted, Sir Bodkin
asked Large Runner to come and back-stitch
it.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“It must be sewed good and strong to
stand the strain of holding heavy marbles,”
said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>With Margaret’s right fingers holding him,
Large Runner went to one end of the seam,
at the corner of the bag, and began to step
along, singing:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>

      <div class='line'>My toe goes in towards you,</div>
      <div class='line'>Comes out one stitch ahead.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now backward I step,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Across the bottom, around the corner, and
up the side they went, busily sewing the
seam good and strong. At the end the
thread was fastened with three steps on one
spot, and then the basting-thread was pulled
out.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One side of back-stitching looks very
pretty while the other looks something like
a chain,” said Sir Bodkin, “but when done
properly it’s as strong as machine-stitching,
and as near to it as we can do.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret was told to turn down the top of
the little bag one-quarter inch for the first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>turn and three-quarters inch for the second
turn. Then Baster stepped down this casing
for the drawing-string so Large Runner could
hem it down to stay. When done, Margaret
turned the bag right side out. On the fold
side of the bag Sir Bodkin showed her how
to cut a half-inch slit up and down in the
casing. This she blanket-stitched with blue
thread to cover up the raw edges.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The drawing-string goes in and out here,”
he said. “You need only one in a marble-bag.
A shoe-lace will be strong
enough.” Margaret found an odd
one of Jim’s.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I don’t need to run this in the
casing for you ’cause the metal tip
will do the work,” Sir Bodkin said. Margaret
put the shoe-lace tip in the slit and
pushed it through the casing until it came
out again at the slit, with the ends even.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tie the ends tightly together and your

little fellow said to his mistress,
as he bowed very low.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, thank
you,” said Margaret.
“Won’t Jim be tickled to
get this to hold his snappers,
croakies, agates, and

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Yes, he was pleased,” said Margaret to
Sir Bodkin and the One-Eyed Fairies
who asked her how Jim liked his marble-bag.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I say it’s very pleasant when people
like what you make for them,” said the King
wisely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-day I want to do something for
Mother. Of course it’s on something for me
but she had such a lot of baking to do to-day
she couldn’t finish the new middy blouse that
I need to wear to-morrow. We wear them in
‘gym,’ you know, and out in the country in
the summer,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“In Jim?” asked Sir Bodkin somewhat
mystified.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Gymnasium,” explained Margaret, suddenly
remembering that her little friends,
though sharp, might not be so keen on
knowing about things belonging to the great
outside world.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_082.jpg' alt='She went through some simple exercises' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What’s that?” the Fairies all asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” laughed Margaret, “it’s a big room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>with bars and ladders and horses and
rings in it. All kinds of things to do stunts
on.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She could see her little friends were still not
understanding very well what she was talking
about.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll show you some of the things we do
and you will see why I wear easy clothes like
bloomers and middy blouses,” she said and
went through some simple exercises of bending,
twisting, and stepping.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! how funny!” cried the Fairies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hush!” commanded the King frowning at
them. “Very interesting, My Lady,” he
said turning politely to Margaret, “and what
is there about the blouse to be finished?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s all done but the eyelets for the
lacings,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! they’re easy and fun,” he told her.
“You’ll need a stiletto to punch the holes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Then you overcast the edges of the hole so
the lacings can go in and out easily.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where shall I get a stiletto and what is
it?” Margaret asked Sir Bodkin. She thought
he was a very funny little man to be always
asking for the queerest things.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Your Mother must have one in her work-basket
or her sewing-table or her embroidery-bag,
I’m thinking,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll look. I don’t want to disturb her
’cause she’s so busy. But she doesn’t mind
when I look through her things if I leave them
just as I find them,” she told him. “What
does the stiletto look like?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s made either of bone or of ivory or of
steel and is about four inches long. It’s very
sharp at one end to pierce the material and
the other end is usually fancy,” he explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret thought she could find it and
went out of the room to search for one among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>her Mother’s things. While she was gone Sir
Bodkin and the One-Eyed Fairies tried to
bend and twist and turn as they
had just seen their little mistress
doing a short time before. They
looked very funny as they tried to
do these exercises. They were so
stiff.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_085.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Is this it?” Margaret asked
running back into the room and
holding up a white bone stiletto.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin turned around quickly to look.
Margaret was laughing to see how funny they
all looked doing stunts.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered he, “that is what we are
looking for. Where do you want the eyelets
placed, My Lady?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took up the new white middy
blouse to show the King the slit down the
front.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>
<img src='images/i_086a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“This makes it easier to put my head
through and has to be laced with a lacing
after I slip it on,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Three eyelets on a side
would be about right, I think,
don’t you?” he asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said she.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then he told her to measure,
with the tape measure, the eyelet
places evenly apart on each
side of the slit. She marked them with
a lead-pencil dot one-half inch from the
edge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we are ready to punch the holes,”
he said.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_086b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took the stiletto
and pushed the sharp
point up through the two
thicknesses of goods where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>each dot was marked. She turned it around
and around to make the hole evenly shaped.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Some like to punch from the right side
down, but I prefer to punch from the wrong
side up,” Sir Bodkin said.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the holes were ready Sir Bodkin told
Margaret to get some fine white twist or
embroidery cotton. Calling a large-eyed
Stitcher, the King had Margaret harness him
ready to begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have your stiletto ready and keep pushing
it through the eyelet as you go along whipping
the edge. This keeps the shape nice and
round,” said the King. “Now, sir, do your
work,” he then said to the Stitcher, who
stepped from the wrong side through to the
edge of the hole and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“First run around the edge,</div>
      <div class='line'>We take a little run.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then over it and over it</div>
      <div class='line'>The stitching is done.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Step over to the wrong side,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then through to the right</div>
      <div class='line'>Not far from the edge,</div>
      <div class='line'>And pull the thread tight.</div>
      <div class='line'>Then over again,</div>
      <div class='line'>And so on, you see,</div>
      <div class='line'>Keeping stitches as tiny</div>
      <div class='line'>And close as can be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<div class='ic006'>
<p>Making eyelets</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Every few whipping-stitches Margaret
would leave Stitcher sticking in his tracks on
the edge and take up the
stiletto with her right fingers
and put it through
the eyelet from the wrong
side. This kept the shape
round.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When you have gone
around the eyelet edge, step
through to the wrong side
and fasten the thread,” said
Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>This Margaret and Stitcher did after each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>eyelet was finished. Soon the six were all
done.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_089.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I think it’s great fun!” cried Margaret
looking with pride at the pretty little round
eyelets ready for their lacing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sometimes eyelets are used in embroidery,”
said Sir Bodkin, “so you will know how
if you ever should wish to do that kind.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The One-Eyed Fairies skipped across the
table and disappeared into
the work-basket for Margaret’s
mother, Mrs. Allen,
could be heard calling her
little daughter to come to
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’ll be so pleased to see
these and surprised, too,” whispered Margaret
to Sir Bodkin as he stood on the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, My Lady,” he replied. He made a
low bow to his little mistress and slipped into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>the work-basket. Margaret hurried to her
Mother’s room with the finished middy blouse.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I must say you and the One-Eyed
Fairies certainly are very clever indeed,” you
could have heard Mrs. Allen remark if you
had been standing outside her door just then.</p>

</div>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_091.jpg' alt='Designs in Cross-Stitch' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“What a lovely rainy day!” cried
Margaret coming into her room
singing happily to herself. She did not mind
the rain at all for she was very anxious to
get to work. It would
soon be her Auntie’s
birthday and Margaret
wanted to give her
a present. So Mother
had bought down-town
a linen towel with the
ends finished with hemstitching done by machine.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can trim it at one end, above the
hem, with a design done in cross-stitch,” she
had said to Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“That will be pretty!” Margaret had replied.
“I’ll ask Sir Bodkin how to do it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret now had the towel and a book of
cross-stitch designs in her hands as she came
into the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I wonder which would be nicer, a design
or her initials done in cross-stitch?” she was
asking herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Looking up she saw Sir Bodkin hopping
out of the work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So it’s cross-stitch to-day, My Lady?”
he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes it is. How bright you are to guess,”
Margaret answered laughing. She showed
him the towel to be trimmed and waited for
him to speak.</p>

<p class='c006'>“First of all, we must have some canvas
fine enough to work eight cross-stitches to the
inch. We use the threads of the canvas as
guides where the cross-stitches are to be made.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Second, we must have some embroidery
cotton to make the crosses,” he told Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>She went to ask her mother for these things.
They were found in her magic sewing-box, and
when Sir Bodkin saw her coming back into
the room with the canvas and blue embroidery
cotton in her hand he called Baster out to
help. Baster fastened
the canvas nice and
straight to the center
of one end of the towel,
on the right side just above the hem. Then
Crewel was harnessed with a strand of the
blue cotton in his long eye.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_093.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What is the design to be?” asked Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>

<img src='images/i_094.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Cross-stitch</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I think it would be very pretty to mark
this towel, which is for my Auntie’s birthday,
with her initials,” replied Margaret. “They
are the same as mine, ‘M. A.’ This book
of patterns shows how
many squares to use to
make the letters.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” said the King,
“the letters will be large
or small according to
the number of squares
used. Very good. Now,
sir, watch your step and
be sure to step over the
canvas threads and not
through them, or we can’t pull them out
when the work is finished!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Crewel One, who stood waiting, stepped
to the wrong side of the towel and fastened
the cotton with two or three tiny back steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>where the first cross was to be made. Then
he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Step out at one corner, cross, step in another,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out again at the third, to the fourth one cross over.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now through to the wrong side; to start the next one,</div>
      <div class='line'>The top thread of each cross, the same way must run.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“There you are!” cried Sir Bodkin, “that’s
the first cross-stitch. The others are just
like it. Follow the pattern and make a cross-stitch
where the pattern shows a square.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret followed the pattern very carefully
with her eye and guided the Crewel One
with her fingers to make the cross-stitches in
both letters. Jauntily they stepped along
until the work was done and the “M. A.”
embroidered. Then the thread was fastened
securely.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we are through with the canvas.
Cut it away from around the letters. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>pull out the threads of what is left very carefully
from under the cross-stitches and your
towel is trimmed. Take a warm iron and
press the letters on the wrong side on something
soft, and the crosses will stand out on
the right side and look very pretty,” said Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_096.jpg' alt='“Press the letters on the wrong side”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Then I shall fold it in three lengthwise
folds as Mother does, with the center on top
to show the letters, and wrap it up in white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>tissue paper!” cried Margaret. “Thank you
three so much. Auntie will be pleased with
her birthday present, I know.”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_097.jpg' alt='MA' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You’re very welcome, My Lady, so say
I and so say they!” cried the King, very
much pleased, too.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Margaret had run off to show her
mother the pretty towel finished, Sir Bodkin
said to his two subjects,
“She is a pretty nice little
girl. She’s always thinking
up something to do for
other people.”</p>

<p class='c006'>They both agreed with
him and all three slipped
into the work-basket to the
needle-book and went to sleep with the other
One-Eyed Fairies.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Dear me, it’s so lovely outdoors,”
sighed Margaret, one day in May.
She had torn her new dress on a nail when she
was climbing over a fence.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother says it was
very careless of me and
I s’pose I can’t go out
again until it’s mended!”
She looked very unhappy
indeed as she said this.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can mend it outdoors,”
said her little Fairy friend peeping out
of the work-basket. “Sit out in the garden
under the trees. We’d just love to get out in
the sunshine,” he finished wistfully.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>
<img src='images/i_099.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! you dear little things!” cried Margaret.
“How dull for you to be shut up in
this stuffy work-basket all the time and never
get a peep outside. I’ll take you out now as
soon as I change my new dress for my old one.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When they were in the garden Margaret
looked at the damage the nail had done to her
dress. There was an
ugly, three-cornered
tear. The King
called Runner to help
with the task of making
the torn place
look like new. With
thread the same color
as the dress for harness,
Runner was
soon ready to begin. Sir Bodkin sat on a
tiny green vine to direct the work. Margaret
took the dress in her left hand, wrong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>side out, and guided the tiny Fairy with her
right hand and the work began with this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“O’er left forefinger hold the tear,</div>
      <div class='line'>And with the right hand mend.</div>
      <div class='line'>Across and back take running steps,</div>

      <div class='line'>Draw edges close, but not too tight,</div>
      <div class='line'>Take short runs round the turn.</div>
      <div class='line'>To other end run smoothly on,</div>
      <div class='line'>’Tis not so hard to learn!”</div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>While they were working, the birds were
singing and the sweet
smell of the flowers
entranced them.
When the ugly tear
was mended and the
dress made nearly as
good as new again,
Margaret sighed with relief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Time was long ago in your great-grandmother’s
day, young ladies used to tear their
muslin dresses purposely to show how prettily
they could mend,” Sir Bodkin told Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They did?” she cried in surprise. “How
funny!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now to make it look flat, give this mended
tear a dose of warm iron on the wrong side,”
Sir Bodkin advised.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you, Your Highness. What
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>should I do without you and the One-Eyed
Fairies to help me out of trouble? You’re all
the most wonderful things!” cried Margaret
with shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We can’t help it. We’re Fairies! ’Sides
I’m a King,” he said proudly, “and ought to
be different from the rest.” The fresh air
and sunshine were making him feel very fine
indeed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_102.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Some girls and boys called to Margaret just
then from a neighbor’s garden and she ran
hastily away to join them.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin and the other Needle Fairies
slipped down into the green grass for a frolic.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Pretty soon Margaret’s mother came out of
the house. She saw the dress and work-basket
lying on the garden seat.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_103.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How nicely she mended her dress!” she
said. “I’ll take it in for her,” and gathered it
and the work-basket in her arms and carried
them all into the house. The little Fairies
were frightened to see their house taken
away. Together they huddled around the
garden seat wondering how in the world they
would get back again into the big house.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The dew will be very bad for us!” said the
King in distress.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret came running
back when she heard the
supper gong. Her bright
eyes, luckily, spied them
in the grass. Stooping,
she picked them up one
by one and carried them into the house in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>her hand. She laid them down on a table
in the hall and went in to her supper.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin was very much worried. He
walked up and down and up and down the
table-top.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know we’ll be forgotten here and we may
be lost on the floor!” he said over and over
to himself. He heard his little mistress after
supper go out in the kitchen to press her dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! perhaps she’ll remember where she
put us!” the poor little King kept saying to
his subjects.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret came out of the kitchen and was
about to go up-stairs when she remembered
her little friends. Picking them up again in
her hand she carried them this time safely
up-stairs to her own room and stuck them in
the tomato pincushion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To-morrow I’ll give you all a nice emery
bath,” she said to them.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XII  <span class='large'>LACY FRILLS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret held up the dainty new
white dress she had been making
for her doll. It was now all finished except
the lace frills.</p>

<p class='c006'>“When we sew the lace around the collar
and sleeves for trimming, your new dress will
be ready for you to wear to the tea-party to-morrow,”
said the little mother to her
doll as she tried on her new dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Doesn’t she look sweet!” whispered all
the little One-Eyed Fairies to each other,
peeping out of the work-basket to look at the
doll in her pretty white dress which they had
just helped to sew. They were very fond of
Margaret and her doll.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>
<img src='images/i_106.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin!” Margaret called to the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here I am, My Lady,” he answered
scrambling out of the
work-basket and up to
the top of the table. He
leaned himself against the
pincushion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think we’ll need a dainty Stitcher to
sew these frills, don’t you?” his little mistress
asked him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and harness of fine white cotton
thread,” answered his Majesty.
He then called all the Stitchers out of the
work-basket. They were up on the table-top
in a twinkling, waiting for their King to choose
those needed for the work. Two Stitchers
were selected, one larger than the other.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One for gathering the lace and one for
sewing it on,” explained Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Before you begin, take a plunge through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the emery to make you glisten and glide,”
said the King.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_107.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took out her
emery-bag and held it for
the Stitchers to take several
quick plunges. They waited
in the pincushion while she
went to wash her hands, to
keep the lace clean as it was being sewed on
the dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fine Stitcher was harnessed with white
cotton thread number 80. The larger one
was harnessed with the same thread doubled
for gathering the lace.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Make his harness longer than the frill is
to be when finished,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How much lace shall I cut off for the
collar and sleeves?” asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This is the rule for the length of a ruffle
or a lace edging,” said Sir Bodkin and sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“When making a ruffle</div>
      <div class='line'>Or sewing on lace,</div>
      <div class='line'>Measure once and a half</div>
      <div class='line'>’Round the sewing on space.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_108.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How shall I finish these ends?” Margaret
asked when she had measured
and cut a piece of lace
for the collar.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tiny Stitcher will hem
them for you before you begin
to gather,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was no sooner said than done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The lace for each sleeve is sewed together
at the ends with a French seam,” said the
King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes, I remember. Sew the ends together
first on the right side, turn the seam,
and then sew it on the wrong side so no raw
edges will show, just like we did on the marble-bag,”
Margaret cried.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>“Yes, that’s right. This makes a very
neat seam,” Sir Bodkin told her.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_109.jpg' alt='Gathering lace Sewing on lace' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Mark with pins, the half and quarters of
each of the three lace frills. Then mark the
half and quarters of the collar and sleeve
edges,” Sir Bodkin said and sang this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mark the half and quarters of edge and of frill,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the gathers will then the space evenly fill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now fasten your gathering-thread securely
on the right side at one end of the top
(or straight edge) of the collar lace,” said the
King.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“You don’t have to gather all kinds of
lace, My Lady,” he went on to say; “in some
you just pull the cord in the top. Stitcher,
step evenly along the top and gather the frill.
Let the needle hang loose at the other end.
Pin the frill half and quarters to those of the
collar, right sides together.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Margaret had done this and was
ready to sew the tiny frill to the collar, Sir
Bodkin finished the song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Hold the gathers next to you</div>
      <div class='line'>When frill is sewed on,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then the ruffle will set well,</div>
      <div class='line'>And never look drawn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Draw up the gathering-thread to fit and
wind it around a pin at the end in a figure
eight. You are now ready for tiny Stitcher
to overcast the lace on for you,” said the
King.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>
<img src='images/i_111.jpg' alt='“’Tis done at last”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Tiny Stitcher fastened the thread at the
right end of the collar frill top. Then over
the edge he stepped and came back through
dress and lace towards Margaret. She pulled
the thread through and he stepped over the
edge away from her and through again, always
going from her right towards her left.
Margaret guided him with her right hand and
held the dress in her left. When the frill was
sewed on all around the collar, the thread
was fastened securely at the end and snipped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>off. The gathering-thread was also fastened
and snipped.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_112.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Now take a gathering-thread the proper
length for each sleeve frill and fasten it at the
seam. Then gather each lace frill in turn and
pin the half and quarters of each to those of
each sleeve edge and overcast just as you did
before,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret worked very carefully and soon
snipped the threads, and put the little
Stitchers in the pincushion to rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>She made some pretty blue
satin ribbon bows to add to
the little dress as a finishing
touch, and sewed them on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Tis done at last,” she
said, with a sigh of joy, slipping
the lovely party-dress on over her doll’s
curly hair. “You’ll be the sweetest doll at
the tea-party, I know,” she said happily.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>The tiny King and his subjects danced
around in an admiring ring.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We thank our little friends very much,
don’t we, dear?” Margaret said to her doll.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Look out or you’ll tear your clothes!”
cried Margaret to her brother Jim
one day as they climbed through a barbed-wire
fence out in the fields.</p>

<p class='c006'>They were visiting Auntie’s farm. It was
great fun to go swimming, hunt eggs, feed
chickens, ride on top of the big hay-loads and
just be outdoors all the time. Both children
had exactly the right clothes for such good
times—middy and bloomers for Margaret,
blouse and overalls for Jim. Besides these,
not much else was needed, for Auntie let
them run barefoot most of the time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, pshaw! now I’ve done it! Ouch! I’m
caught!” the next minute Jim cried out to
his sister, who was herself clambering very
carefully over the wire so the sharp little
barbs would do no damage.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>
<img src='images/i_115.jpg' alt='“Ouch! I’m caught”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Wait! I’ll get you loose!” Margaret exclaimed
coming to his rescue. With pulling
and tugging he was soon free, but a big ugly
hole was torn in the seat of his overalls.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Would you look at that! And the last
clean ones I have, too,” Jim said in despair.
It certainly was a sad accident, for this was
their last day on the farm and there were lots
of things to do for the last time.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Never mind. I’ll mend them for you,”
Margaret said. “Jump into your bathing-suit
and while you’re taking a swim I’ll be
mending these. Boys certainly are a care,”
she said to herself with a sigh on her way up
to her room. But in her heart she was really
quite delighted at the chance to show her
sewing skill.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin!” she called when she was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>up-stairs in her bedroom. All the One-Eyes
were hiding in a pretty sewing-bag that she
had made to carry them in when travelling.
She loosened the drawing-string and out
popped Sir Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_117.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Well, well, I wondered when you’d be
calling us out this trip,” he said shaking himself
and walking around the bureau-top to
stretch his legs.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the trouble now? I s’pose it’s
trouble or you wouldn’t be needing us on a
vacation,” he went on to say.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” laughed Margaret, “it’s trouble and
it needs to be doctored right away.” She
held up the torn overalls for him to see.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, I should say so. Patching is the
thing for that big tear. Take your scissors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>and cut off the ragged edges to make the
hole as round as you can. Have you some
of the same goods for a patch?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think Auntie has. I’ll go see,” and Margaret
ran off to inquire.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sure enough, Auntie had something in her
scrap-bag that would do very well. Margaret
ran back eager to begin patching.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cut a square piece, an inch and a half

the patch runs the same way of the goods as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the overalls,” said Sir Bodkin beckoning to
Baster, who was sticking his head out of the
bag.</p>

<p class='c006'>While he and Margaret were working Sir
Bodkin sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“When the piece you attach</div>
      <div class='line'>In making a patch,</div>
      <div class='line'>Be sure you baste it firm.</div>
      <div class='line'>Or while you sew,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slipping ’round it will go</div>
      <div class='line'>And all over the garment squirm.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret laughed at this song.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now on the wrong side turn in the four
sides of the patch and baste them down,”
said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>They soon had this done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Snip the cloth all around the edge of the
hole, turn it under and baste it down to the
patch. Do this on the right side,” said Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Hemmer,” he called. She came and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>harnessed with strong thread. After that she
neatly sewed down the edge of the hole to the
patch on the right side. Then she sewed the
four edges of the patch to the overalls on the
wrong side.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Be sure your steps are tiny and firm so
the patch will stand wear,” the King cautioned.
Then as they worked he sang this
song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The hemming must catch</div>
      <div class='line'>The hole firm to the patch</div>
      <div class='line'>So the edges will never rip out.</div>
      <div class='line'>When patch edges you do</div>
      <div class='line'>Hem them firmly, too,</div>
      <div class='line'>And the patching will hold good and stout.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When the patching was done, Margaret
held up the mended overalls so Sir Bodkin
and his helpers could see.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good work,” said he proudly. “Looks
as fine as a patch can. We don’t use patches
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>where they will show if we can help, for they
aren’t very pretty, but anything useful is not
to be despised. They are very useful on
underwear, aprons, table-linen and bed-linen
and many other things.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>Jim was delighted when he came back

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret was home again from the
country. Vacation was nearly over
and in another week school would begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How would you like to look over your
clothes and see that they are in good order?”
her mother said to her one day. “Wouldn’t
it be a good plan to sew on the missing buttons
and see that the others are on firmly and
not hanging by their eyelids?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin would like it. He can sing
me a little song all about buttons. He loves
to sing and tell you what to do, you know,”
laughed Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s a very good idea. What he has
to say seems always to be right,” said Mrs.
Allen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret went to her room to look over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>her clothes. Sure enough, here was a button
gone and there, one loose.</p>

<p class='c006'>“’Most everything needs a little dose of
thread and needle after a vacation, I s’pose,”
she said to herself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_124.jpg' alt='There they all were' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>When all the garments needing buttons were
piled on her bed, Margaret called her little
friend, but he did not respond from the work-basket
at all.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Whatever is the matter and wherever is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>he?” Margaret asked herself. Then she
remembered that he and the others were still
in the sewing-bag she had carried away on her
trip. She found it hanging on a hook in her
closet. When she pulled open the draw-strings,
there they all were.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin!” she called.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Where are we?” asked a sleepy voice.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Safe at home again,” replied the little
mistress. “I forgot to take
you out and put you in
your home. But first I’ll
give you all a rest in the
fresh air in the pincushion,”
she said and stuck each one
in as she talked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are we to do to-day,
My Lady?” asked Sir
Bodkin from the table-top where he stood
putting his crown on straight.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“I’m getting my clothes ready for school
next week and there are some buttons to be
fastened on,” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s fun. Bring on your buttons and
then we’ll know what to do,” said the tiny
King.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret obeyed him and brought over the
garments with missing buttons.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here’s a slipper-button gone, and a pearl
one from my dress, a bone one from my under-waist,
one from my dress with the button
trimming, and one from my coat,” said
Margaret all out of breath.</p>

<p class='c006'>“First the shoe-button. That’s a shank
button. Some black patent thread and a
thick Stitcher with a big eye will soon fix it,”
he said to Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Measure your thread and wax it with
your beeswax, make a knot in one end. Find
the place where the button was sewed before.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Now, sir, push up from the wrong side of the
slipper-strap to the right side and straight
through the shank of the button, then back
to the wrong side again,” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! that’s stiff. I had to push him hard
with my thimble!” cried Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the way. Now through again
several more times, then fasten the thread on
the wrong side and that’s done!” Sir Bodkin
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Better give the button on the other
slipper a few stitches to be sure it doesn’t
come off,” he then said when the first was on
good and tight. They did this.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Bring on the next!” ordered the King.
Margaret showed him her gingham dress
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>and a pearl button with four tiny holes in
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Come here,” the King then said to a
medium-sized Stitcher who was then harnessed
with white cotton thread doubled. When
the knot was made they were ready to begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Cross the center,” the King said to the
Fairy, who stepped from the wrong side of the
dress through to the right side and up through
one of the tiny holes in the button which
Margaret was holding for him. Then he
crossed over the center to the opposite hole
and slid down through to the wrong side again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now up through the other hole and cross
again,” said Sir Bodkin which the Stitcher
did and slid back to the wrong side again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“See how neat that looks,” said the King
to Margaret when it was sewed on, as she and
Stitcher wound the thread round and round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>underneath the button to make a shank for it
to play on, and then fastened the thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A pretty way to sew on pearl buttons for
trimming is to come
out one hole every time
and go in the other three from it like this,”
he said taking his toe and pointing on the
button.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now for that bone button, clumsy but
useful,” said the King. It had two holes
and was sewed on the under-waist, with the
thread doubled, the same way as the pearl
one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now for the pretty pink pearl!” cried
Sir Bodkin who was very fond of that color.
Margaret brought her dress and the button
which was cut with a shank on it. It belonged
down the front of her dress in a row
with many other buttons.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This goes on very much like the shoe-button,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>but doesn’t have to be sewed so strong,
for it is only an ornament,” Sir Bodkin explained.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this one was on Margaret brought
her coat and a
pretty cloth covered
button, all
smooth on top and metal underneath, with
a funny little round place of cloth to sew
through.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must not show on the wrong side
where the button is sewed on a coat. If you
want to make it very strong you may sew
through a tiny little pearl button, the same
color as your coat, on the wrong side. But this
one we shall fasten on the right side blindly
but quite strong.” The thick Stitcher was
harnessed with heavy dark thread doubled
and waxed and knotted.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Catch your thread on the coat, first on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>the spot where the button is to go and then,
second, sir, as you know, step through the
sewing-place underneath the button. Third,
through the coat again and so on. But
whatever you do, don’t step through to the
wrong side so it will show!” said Sir Bodkin.
Then the button was sewed securely and the
thread fastened and snipped. Stitcher rested
in the pincushion.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You haven’t sung to-day!” Margaret
said to the One-Eyed Fairies.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To be sure we haven’t, My Lady!” their
King said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then one of the little Stitchers came out
of the pincushion and began to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Sewing on buttons</div>
      <div class='line'>And mending your clothes</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Every one laughed and clapped their hands

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>School had begun, and Margaret was so
busy for the first few weeks with her
lessons, her play, and her friends, that she had
not seen much of her little One-Eyed Fairy
friends.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s much better for her to be outdoors a
lot this nice weather than sitting indoors
sewing. Plenty of time for that later on,”
said the King one day. “Of course it’s very
fine to know how to sew, but ‘All work and no
play makes Jack a dull boy,’” he quoted to
his shining subjects in the work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>They all agreed with him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“She’ll be needing one of us some day soon,
you’ll see,” said the Crewel One knowingly to
the others.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Just then they heard Margaret coming up
the stairs singing to herself. She came into
her room carrying over her arm a new dress
of dark blue. She called Sir Bodkin out of
his home and he came quickly in response.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_134.jpg' alt='Coming up the stairs singing to herself' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“My new dress is finished and ready to
wear to school when the weather gets cooler.
Mother says it should have a bright trimming
on it. She thought that perhaps you could
think of something pretty, Sir Bodkin,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Margaret to her One-Eyed Fairy friend and
counselor.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A-hem! Let me think!” replied Sir Bodkin
wisely as he stood on her hand. He was
always so proud when she asked his advice.
He shone all over with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let me see now; your dress is blue serge,
isn’t it? How would you fancy a scarlet
trimming of some kind of stitchery? Crewel
can step off a pretty chain of silk stitches for
you,” the King said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_135.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! that would be lovely, I think!” cried
Margaret delightedly.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Very well, if you have some scarlet floss,
we can begin at once,” Sir Bodkin answered,
hopping down into the work-basket to call
the Crewel One. That fancy fellow was
listening to the conversation and was ready
to come out.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret laid the new dress on
a chair and ran off to tell her
mother what was needed to trim
it. Presently she returned with
some glistening red silk floss ready
to work. When the Crewel One
was harnessed with a proper length
of it in his eye he took three running
steps and a back step on the
wrong side to hold it fast. Then
he stepped through the cloth to
the right side of the dress, one inch from the
edge of the neck. He was ready to work
and began to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“With the floss, make a loop,</div>
      <div class='line'>Hold it with your thumb.</div>
      <div class='line'>Back I jump, step in again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Out through the loop I come.</div>
      <div class='line'>Pulling after me the floss,</div>
      <div class='line'>To make a loop again,</div>
      <div class='line'>Looping, stepping, right along</div>
      <div class='line'>We make a pretty chain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Around the neck one inch from the edge
frolicked the Crewel One with the floss in his
eye and the pink fingers of Margaret’s right
hand holding him. In her left hand she held
the dress. Looping and stepping along their
way a pretty trimming was soon formed.
When the chain was finished, the floss was
fastened securely on the wrong side of the
dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That looks good. Now do the armholes
the same way. Be sure you link the two
ends of the chain together on the underneath
side of each armhole before you fasten the
floss,” said the King.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>
<img src='images/i_138.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Sire,” answered the Crewel One
respectfully.</p>

<p class='c006'>He and Margaret worked busily for a while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now they are both done and my dress is
trimmed. I must say it looks wonderful!”
said Margaret at last.</p>

<p class='c006'>Crewel skipped away to the
table-top and began to jump
rope with the strand of floss that
was left over.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I didn’t know you liked to
jump rope as we girls do,” said
Margaret to him, laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must keep myself in trim,
you know,” he said very seriously.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret giggled at this and took up her
dress to go out of the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I thank you both very much,” she said
hurrying away to show her mother how pretty
the new dress looked finished.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
<img src='images/i_139.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin and the Crewel One are very
fine friends for my little daughter to have.
How charming your dress
looks now it is trimmed
with that scarlet chain-stitching!”
said her mother.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We had a ‘Crewel
Frolic,’” laughed Margaret
catching the punning habit
from her One-Eyed friends.
“And I certainly think they
say comical things, don’t
you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered her mother, “they are
very wonderful, indeed.”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVI  <span class='large'>MARGARET MAKES BUTTON HOLES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>“Oh, Mother dear, we’re going on the
most wonderful hike to-morrow!
Are my new bloomers ready to wear?” cried
Margaret one afternoon as she ran into the
house after school.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They are finished except the buttonholes,
which I am about to cut and make now,” her
mother replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then the telephone bell rang and Mrs. Allen
was obliged to talk about something so important
that Margaret knew it might take up
a good deal of time before dinner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I believe I’ll run up-stairs and ask Sir
Bodkin to show <i>me</i> how to make these buttonholes,”
she said to herself. Suiting the action
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>to the word she picked up the new bloomers
and ran up-stairs with them to her own room.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_141.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin,” she called.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here I come,” he answered hopping out of
the work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know how to
make buttonholes?” she
asked him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well I should say so,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s fine, for I want to
make two in the band of my new bloomers,”
said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Have you any buttonhole scissors?” he
then asked her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think Mother has. I’ll run and get
them,” Margaret replied, hurrying out of the
room. In a jiffy she was back again with a pair
of odd-looking scissors in her hand. They had
a notch in the blades and a screw on the handle.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>“There we are,” he cried; “now show me
the buttons to go through the holes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret showed him two black bone
buttons.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_142.jpg' alt='“Follow a thread of the goods”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“The top of the button will show how large
to cut the buttonhole,” Sir Bodkin said.
“Turn the screw until the blades cut a slit a
tiny bit longer than the button top is wide.
Test or try the size on a scrap of cloth before
cutting the holes in your band.”</p>

<p class='c006'>When Margaret had done this and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>scissors were set just right, she slipped them
over the edge at one end of the band where
the buttonhole was to be and waited.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Begin to cut one-quarter inch from the
edge of the band. Follow a thread of the
goods to cut the hole straight,” said Sir
Bodkin. “Cut one hole at a time, then work
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret cut the first hole. Sir Bodkin
called a stout Stitcher and he was harnessed
with black cotton thread, a small knot at one
end.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now to your work!” the King said,
“and don’t forget you begin at the end
farthest away from the edge,—turning your
work as you sew.”</p>

<p class='c006'>He told Margaret to hold the buttonhole
along her left forefinger with the starting end
next the finger-tip and the top of the band
towards her. Stitcher slipped between the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>two layers of cloth at the starting end and
came out towards Margaret, a little distance
away from the edge of
the slit. Then Stitcher
jumped along the side of
the buttonhole to the
other end, across the end
under the goods, out and
around back along the other side.</p>

place where he started. Then he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Now over and over the edge we skip,</div>

      <div class='line'>Along each side, ’round each end go,</div>
      <div class='line'>Catching down the long bar threads as we sew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the overcasting,” said Sir Bodkin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>when they were through. “The buttonhole
stitch will need heavier thread.”</p>

<div class='ic006'>

<p class='c006'>Stitcher was harnessed with some, and
then stepped on the wrong side of the buttonhole
at the starting
end to fasten the
thread with tiny back
steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This buttonhole-stitch will cover the
bar and overcasting,”
he said. “Now turn your work around,
so that the starting end will be at your right

<p class='c006'>“My! that was a teeny bit hard to do,”

finished. She took a little
rest before starting the
other one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They aren’t easy the
first time. You have to
mind your P’s and Q’s.
But ‘Practice makes perfect,’”
said the King to her.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Keep buttonhole

<p class='c006'>When the second one was done, Sir Bodkin

sewed each button on

<p class='c006'>Just as she finished
she heard her mother calling to her that dinner

<p class='c006'>“I wonder what she’ll say when she

and scraping.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>One day Margaret and her little friends,
the One-Eyes, were talking together
about grandparents.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You never had any grandmother or
grandfather, did you?” Margaret asked Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course we had them just
like everybody else but we never
saw them. They were very funny;
you’ll laugh when I tell you their
names,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh! please tell me!” urged
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, thorns and briers were
their names!” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why, how funny, for they grow outdoors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>on trees and bushes!” cried Margaret trying
not to laugh for she thought this sounded
very queer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Just so. Yes, our great-grandparents,
as I’m telling you, used to grow outdoors.
They were the first One-Eyed Fairies. The
people who made them lived outdoors, too.
Then our grandparents were made of ivory
and bone and were cut from bones and tusks.
They lasted many a long day, I can tell you.
Even to-day when some place is uncovered
where people used to live hundreds of years
ago, you’ll find a grandparent lying fast
asleep with one eye open wide.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_150.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You are a funny man. I never know
what you are about to tell me,” Margaret
said to him. “Now that reminds me that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Mother has cut out and hemmed on the
machine, the dearest little white apron for
me to give my Grandma Thanksgiving Day
when we go there to dinner. Do you know
how to put in tucks?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Upon my word I do. Just show me
where they’re to go and I’ll show you how to
put them in,” proudly said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret went to get the gift and soon
returned with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Look here!” she said and held up a
piece of white lawn, hemmed on the sides and
across the bottom. It was twenty-seven
inches wide and several inches longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother allowed some material for the
three tucks,” Margaret explained. “She said
each tuck was to be one-quarter inch wide and
one-half inch apart. We can baste in the
tucks, can’t we? Then Mother will stitch
them in on her machine.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“Oh, yes, My Lady, we can easily do that.
First we shall have to measure the distance,
then crease them in, then baste,” Sir Bodkin
told her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took the tape measure out of her
work-basket and the tucking began.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_152.jpg' alt='“Measure one inch up from the hem top”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Measure one inch up from the hem top
and crease the first tuck with your nail then
pleat it with your fingers across the bottom
of the apron,” Sir Bodkin said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret creased very carefully and every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>so often measured until she had marked the
tuck across from one side of the little apron
to the other.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_153.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“That looks very even. Now, Baster, you
rogue, baste this tuck very carefully,” said
the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>Baster was harnessed with basting-thread,
with the end knotted and then he waited for
his little mistress to begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Step along the tuck
one-quarter inch from the
creased edge. Take medium-sized
steps, sir,” ordered
Sir Bodkin, “but
before you start take a
few slides back and forth through the emery
to glide in and out easily. Lawn is a little
stiff sometimes, My Lady,” he said to Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>After Baster was shined as bright in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>emery as he could be shined, Margaret held
the tuck in her left hand and with her right
pushed and held Baster as he stepped along.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Use your tape measure, as you go along,
to be sure he keeps his steps in the right track
always from the top,” reminded Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That one is basted,” cried Margaret at
the end of the first tuck.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_154.jpg' alt='Basting first tuck' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“And very nicely done, too,” praised the
King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How shall I measure the second one?”
asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“Measure one inch from the basting for
the second crease,” answered Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the second tuck was creased and
basted and the third one done the same way,
Margaret measured the apron from top to
bottom.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t they take up the goods fast? It’s
about twenty-seven inches long now,” she
laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s what tucks do. They always
take up twice as much goods as they are
wide. We use them for dresses to allow for
shrinking. And to allow for children growing,
too,” he laughed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I know that,” said Margaret, “for
Mother is always putting tucks in my clothes
then taking them out, I grow so fast.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then we use them for trimming, as in
this apron. There are wide tucks and narrow
tucks and pin tucks. Pin tucks go in babies’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>bonnets and dresses. Sometimes we hold a
little cord in the crease and sew along it.
These corded tucks are very pretty for sheer
materials,” he said.</p>

<div  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/i_156.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>Tucks basted ready for stitching</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“And what kinds are
they?” asked Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, those fine
enough to see through,
like lawn and swiss and
organdie,” answered
Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This begins to look
pretty. When Mother
stitches these tucks on
the machine and the
bastings are pulled out, then I’m going to gather
the top and sew it on a band,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s fun!” cried Sir Bodkin. “I just
love to put on bands.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“We’ll do that another day. I must run
out now and do my errands for Mother,”
Margaret said folding her work and jumping
up from her little chair.</p>

laughed running out of the room with the
folded apron in her hand.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the antics of his happy-go-lucky subject as

“Enough’s enough!”</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XVIII  <span class='large'>FINISHING THE GIFT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Next day after school Margaret ran
up to her room carrying the little
lawn apron to be finished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin, I’m here. Just see how nice
these tucks are sewed in by machine. And
look! Mother put a cunning pocket on the
right hand side for Grandma to tuck her
handkerchief in,” she said.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_159.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin stood up quickly from the
table-top where he had been resting since
yesterday.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Yes, My Lady, it looks very neat indeed.
Of course I’m old fashioned and prefer hand-sewing
to machine-sewing but I know there
is so much to do these days that time can be
saved by using the machine,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I’m glad you think these tucks look
well, ’cause I stitched ’em myself. Mother
let me try,” Margaret said proudly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I must say you kept it straight,” Sir
Bodkin remarked. “Now, how about the
band for that apron to-day?”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret showed him a piece of lawn
about twenty inches long and two inches
wide. Sir Bodkin told her to fold it over
lengthwise making it one inch wide. Then
he said to crease the fold for the top of the
band. Next he told her to find the center of
the band from the ends and mark it on the
two raw edges with tiny notches.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We are to allow one inch on each end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>beyond the gathers for the long strings to be
sewed on,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then that will leave us eighteen inches
to sew the gathers on. Oh, you Stitcher!”
called Sir Bodkin to one in the pincushion.
He came over and was harnessed for gathering
with a double thread, longer than the gathering-space
was to be.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_161.jpg' alt='“I stitched ’em myself”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t forget to knot the end,” said the
King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, indeedy,” replied Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“Find the center of the apron top and cut
a tiny notch,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>After this was done, Margaret held the
right side of the apron next to her and began
to gather the top one-quarter inch from the
edge, going from right to left.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Run a few stitches on Stitcher and then
pinch them flat to set them,” directed the
King.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the gathers were run in Margaret
pinned the center of the apron top to the center
of one long edge of the band. Nine inches
each way from the center she pinned the ends
of the gathers to the band and drew up the
thread to fit. After which she wound the
thread in a figure eight around a pin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’re a Jim Dandy,” said Sir Bodkin
watching his little mistress. “Now take
Stitcher in your hand and stroke the gathers
with his toe and lay them evenly along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>band so they won’t be too bunchy here and
too skimpy there. But be careful you don’t
scratch the goods,” he said to his subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>Then Baster was harnessed and basted the
gathers to the band above the gathering-thread.
Margaret held the gathers next to
herself.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“One-quarter inch from the edge sew the
gathers to the band. Runner, take back and
running steps, catching up one gather at a
time,” Sir Bodkin said to Margaret and the
Fairy. When this was done and thread fastened,
they fastened the gathering-thread, too.
Then they snipped all threads off and waited.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>“Turn over the other edge of the band
one-quarter inch towards you, crease it and
bring it down on the gathers. Now, Baster,
your turn to step again to hold this fold down
firm,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Then Mother will stitch it on the machine,”
finished Margaret, “and I’ll make
the strings and sew them on and the darling
little apron will be ready to go to Grandma’s.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How will you make the strings, My
Lady?” asked Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I’ll turn over tiny hems on the sides
and a larger one on the ends and they’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>be stitched on the machine. Then I can easily
sew the strings to the ends of the band. And
I’ll put a tiny pink bow on the pocket,” cried
Margaret eagerly.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_165.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Very fetching, and a
lovely gift for a grandmother.
She’ll like it,
I’m sure,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe she’ll want
me to sew some of her
tatting around the edge
’cause she makes yards
and yards of it in her
spare time,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would be pretty, too,” agreed the
tiny King. “It is a matter of choice for:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Some like them trimmed,</div>
      <div class='line'>Some like them plain,</div>

      <div class='line'>They are useful just the same.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Oh, you funny man, that doesn’t rhyme
very well,” laughed Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You get my meaning,” said Sir Bodkin
laughing himself.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_166.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Look at the One-Eyes!” cried Margaret
and they both turned to see the shining little
needle Fairies playing football with the
beeswax from the work-basket. They had
been hearing so much about the game all the
fall they thought they would try it themselves.
Baster was referee. They would kick it high
in the air and then catch it on their heads and
run away with it all around the pincushion in
fine style.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Thank you, dear King, and take good care
of yourself and your Fairies,” said Margaret
before she left the room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin took a walk around the table-top
then ordered his subjects into the pincushion
for the night.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Sir Bodkin looked quite sad as he
stood on Margaret’s table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s been a long time since she called me
to help her,” he said to himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Just then Margaret came into
the room. She was carrying
something over her arm made of
blue chambray material.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Sir Bodkin!” she called. “Oh,
there you are, you dear little
man!” she cried spying him standing on the
table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You’ve not forgotten us, My Lady?” he
said brightening.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course not, you queer little man, I need
your help this minute.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“Oh, that’s good news,” said Sir Bodkin
looking quite himself again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother has cut out the duckiest apron
and cap for me to wear when I cook and do
housework. The hems on the edges must be
sewed and then trimmed some way. Thought
you could tell me how,” explained Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin was so happy he called his One-Eyed
Fairies from the work-basket to sing
and dance on the table.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>cried their King.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“The dear little things,” thought Margaret
to herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now,” said Sir Bodkin when the dance
and frolic was ended, “let’s get to work.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ve turned all the hems around the apron
edge, the neck, pocket-tops, and cap edge,”
said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine! We can baste them. That will
give Baster something to do,” Sir Bodkin
said calling his jolly subject from the needle-book.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret harnessed him and he stepped
along all the tiny hems with quick small
steps.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What kind of trimming do you fancy on
your apron and cap?” asked the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just what I want you to help me
decide,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You could put some kind of stitches for
edging, but I think rickrack braid would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>pretty. It would also hold down the hems
with one sewing,” he told Margaret.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_171.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Then let’s use that. I think it would be
lovely. I’ll ask Mother if she has any,” she
cried and ran off to see.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she came
back she had a little
package in her hand
done up in shiny paper.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now we’re ready,”
said Sir Bodkin.
“Begin at one side of the apron, hold the
wrong side next to you. Place the braid on
the hem so the points will peep out on
the right side and make an even edge. Put
the braid all around the outside edge of the
apron, then you can do all the other edges
and the edge of your cap. Be careful to join
all ends neatly where they meet.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>“Oh, don’t the points look pretty peeping
out on the right side!” cried Margaret as she
and Baster stepped the braid on. It took
time and pains to baste it all on neatly and
join the ends carefully.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Deary me, how slowly we sew ’cause the
thread snarls so!” exclaimed Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You must have a lazy man’s thread,”
replied Sir Bodkin laughing.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What kind is that?” asked Margaret
looking up in surprise.</p>

<p class='c006'>“One that’s too long. Longer than arm’s
length. You might think it easier to use one,
and that you could sew faster. But you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>can’t. It takes longer to pull it through
every time and it’s sure to get snarled and
knotted. A short thread is better,” said Sir
Bodkin. “Did you ever hear the story of
the tailor’s daughter?”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_173.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“No,” said Margaret, “tell it to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well,” began the
King, seating himself on
a spool of thread as they
worked, “it was this
way: Once upon a time
there was an old tailor
who had a very beautiful
daughter. He also
had in his shop two young tailors working
for him. Now both these young tailors
loved the daughter and wanted to marry
her. So each one asked the father for her
hand. They were both good and the old
tailor couldn’t choose between them. So he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>said: ‘The one who can make a suit of
clothes first shall have her.’</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_174.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Each at once set to work on a suit of
clothes and the beautiful daughter threaded
their needles for them. Now one of the two
young tailors was the daughter’s favorite.
Of course she wanted him to get through
first. So she threaded the other one’s needles
with great long threads which made him sew
very slowly. But she threaded with short
threads the needles of the one she loved, and
he sewed so fast that he got through first.
So he won the beautiful daughter’s hand in
marriage and they lived happily ever afterward.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Oh, I’m so glad!” cried Margaret who
dearly loved a story. “That is a lovely
story, Sir Bodkin.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like it quite well myself,” he replied
getting up and looking at the work cap which
Margaret was about to trim with the rickrack
braid.</p>

<p class='c006'>“How does your cap go on your head, My
Lady?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It has an elastic in the casing and is just
a plain round cap,” answered Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The frill falling around your face will
look very sweet with these little white points
on it,” Sir Bodkin said looking admiringly
at his little mistress. “In fact you’ll look
like a princess and you are one, anyway,
for:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“No queen or princess holds more sway,</div>

Margaret delightedly,
with a tiny
lump in her throat.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, My Lady,”
he answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, this braid
is all basted on
now,” she soon told
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Runner can step
it down for you or
it can be sewed on
the machine, just as
you say,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think the machine would be stronger

him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Perhaps it would,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is another set to do to-morrow and
it is just like this one only pink. Then I’ll
have two,” Margaret said happily.</p>

<p class='c006'>“My Lady will be a regular little housewife,
soon,” smiled the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, I want to be one,” Margaret said
putting Baster in the pincushion, “and when

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret had been very busy all
the fall. Now that Thanksgiving
was over the little girl turned her thoughts
towards Christmas and Christmas presents.
She was making a present for
her doll. It was a little cover
for the doll’s bed and one for
the pillow. They were made
of cream-colored muslin and
had designs stamped on them
in black lines, which were to
be embroidered in a colored
embroidery cotton.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know she’ll like a bed-cover, ’cause her
bed hasn’t any to make it look pretty after
it’s made up in the morning,” said Margaret

should have a nice gift.”</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c011'>sang Margaret to the tiny King in her work-basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m singing everything now, just like the
One-Eyes,” she laughed to herself.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin hopped out of
the basket.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good for you, and very
well done,” said he climbing
upon the arm of Margaret’s
chair. “Let me see the pictures
to be embroidered.”</p>

<p class='c006'>She spread the tiny covers
on her lap for him to look over.</p>

<p class='c006'>“They will be very pretty
worked in outline-stitch in one color,” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>told Margaret as he turned himself this way
and that to get a good view from all sides.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I would like to do the design in pink,
’cause my bed is pink and my doll’s bed always
stands over in that corner near mine,” replied
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very good. You’ll need a fast worker.
I’ll call out Race-Horse Embroiderer. Harness
him with pink embroidery cotton and
he’ll step quickly along and cover up those
black lines in no time,” said the King.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_180.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Race-Horse Embroiderer came sliding very
quickly from the needle-book. He stood very
still while Margaret threaded some coarse
embroidery cotton in his eye.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That coarse cotton will work up fast and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>make the picture stand out better,” Sir
Bodkin told his mistress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, you’re right. I just love pink for a
color and so does my doll,” answered Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m partial to it myself,” replied the King.
“We’ll make this a very pretty present.
When the outlines are worked in pink you
can blanket-stitch the edge of each cover in
this pink cotton and the whole thing when
finished will look charming.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret seemed pleased and took the
little cover in her left hand and Embroiderer
in her right. He stepped on the stamped
design where one of the lines began and sang:</p>

“we’re doing that

up the lines and making
them pink with the
stitches that before she
knew it the bed-cover

<p class='c006'>“Doesn’t that look

<p class='c006'>“It does look very dainty and dollified,”
said Sir Bodkin peering down from the chair</p>

to-day, too?”</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_184.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll have to do that to-morrow, for it’s
now time for my errands. Then when the
pillow-cover is outlined we can do the blanket-stitching
’round the edge. It’s all very
pretty and easy to do. I know my doll will
be glad when she sees this present on Christmas
morning,” Margaret
said as she folded up her
work to be placed in her
bureau drawer until next
day.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m afraid if I leave it
out on the work-basket
she’ll see it,” she explained
to Sir Bodkin and
the One-Eyed Fairies,
“and I want it to be a surprise.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“To your place, sir,” whispered Sir Bodkin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>to Embroiderer, “and don’t any of you
breathe a word of this to the doll.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you all very much,” said Margaret.
“I wish I could do something for your
Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Christmas is not for us unless we are
given away to some one in work-baskets or
help people get ready for it. That is pleasure
enough for us, My Lady,” Sir Bodkin answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You are nice all-the-year-round friends,
anyway, and I couldn’t get along without
you,” she said. So the sewing was put away
for the day and was taken up next day and
the day after that until it was finished entirely.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXI  <span class='large'>SOME MORE CHRISTMAS PRESENTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Margaret came into her room a few
days after the doll’s Christmas present
was finished.</p>

<p class='c006'>“More presents to be made?” asked Sir
Bodkin jumping off the pincushion.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_186.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” answered Margaret, “and these
will be the last.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“What are they to be?” asked the King
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mother bought me a third of a yard of
handkerchief linen to make some handkerchiefs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Can you tell me how?” she asked her
friend, holding up some fine white cloth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I suppose the linen is thirty-six inches, or
a yard, wide?” he said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took her tape measure from the
work-basket and measured the goods.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s the width,” Margaret told Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you can cut it into three twelve-inch
squares. First cut off the selvedge on
each end. That’s the woven edge on the
sides of the cloth; and fold the linen in three
across the long way of the piece,” directed
Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Take a One-Eyed Fairy in your hand and
with his toe pick up a thread running the
same way you wish to cut the squares apart.
Pull the thread out and cut where it leaves a
little track. This is called cutting by a
thread,” said he to Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Fold each square over diagonally to see
if it is the same on all four sides. If it is,
then it’s a perfect square and we can go on
with the edges,” Sir Bodkin told his mistress.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_188.jpg' alt='“Fold each square over diagonally”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Each one is perfectly square now,” said
Margaret; “how shall we sew the first one?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“The first one we’ll hemstitch,” said the
King. “Measure one-half inch in from the
edge and pick up and pull out a thread very
carefully across the square. Use the Fairy’s
toe as before. Do another thread towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the center. Do five threads on each side,”
said Sir Bodkin.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Margaret soon had the sides drawn and
ready. Then she turned a tiny hem and
basted it down to the place where the threads
were drawn. Fine Stitcher was harnessed
with number 80 white cotton thread.</p>

<p class='c006'>She held the hem at the top over her left
forefinger. Stitcher came up through it and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>out at the right hand corner ready to start.
He left a trail of thread under the hem to
fasten it. Then he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I start at right corner where threads are drawn</div>
      <div class='line'>And with my little toe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Pick up a tiny bunch of them,</div>
      <div class='line'>Slip underneath towards you.</div>
      <div class='line'>Back over I go and step towards you</div>
      <div class='line'>Beneath the bunch again,</div>
      <div class='line'>But this time stick my little toe</div>
      <div class='line'>Up through the edge of hem.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“There!” cried Sir Bodkin, “you’ve made
your first hemstitch. Keep the bunches of
threads the same size as you go from right to
left and they’ll look even when finished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret and Stitcher went very carefully
along one side to the other corner.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have to be careful when you pick
up the threads in the tiny spaces at the corners
where the cloth is double. Whip the
outside edges of the hems together at the corners
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>so they won’t fray out when washed,”
said Sir Bodkin and waited for this to be
done and the thread fastened.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/i_191.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh,” said Margaret, “that takes care to
make it look nice. And you have to keep
your hands very clean or your work gets
dirty.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Well, My Lady, we can’t have any gains
without pains, you know. Take your time
and be sure to get the bunches
of threads even and all sewing
threads fastened well. Then
this fine white linen handkerchief
hemstitched by hand will
be a present fit for a queen,”
Sir Bodkin replied.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And that will be my Mother!” said Margaret
proudly.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin nodded approval of this. “Suppose
you lay this one away for to-day and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>start the next one. Then you won’t get so
tired. You have plenty of time to finish the
three before Christmas,” said he.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll run and wash my hands again to be
sure they’re clean,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wait a minute. Wet a clean little sponge
or cloth to moisten your fingers when you roll
the hem in this handkerchief,” cried the King
to her before she got out of sight.</p>

<p class='c006'>When she came back Margaret
picked up the square of
linen. Sir Bodkin told her to
trim the corners off round with
her scissors.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Roll the edge of the linen
between your left thumb and
forefinger towards you until
the raw edge is out of sight. Moisten your
fingers a tiny bit and don’t get the hem too
big and clumsy,” cautioned Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>In a few minutes Margaret learned the
knack of hem rolling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s kind of fun, isn’t it?” she said.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, and that one looks good for a first
attempt,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret looked pleased. Then she folded
her work away in the basket.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_193.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Good-bye, dear,” she said to her friend,
“I must run and do my errands now. You’ll
see me to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c006'>All was quiet in the room, after she had
gone, with the mystery of Christmas presents
loaded with pleasant thoughts, waiting to be
finished by their happy maker.</p>

  <h2 class='c004'>CHAPTER XXII  <span class='large'>FINISHING THE HANDKERCHIEFS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Next day Margaret hurried to her
room wearing a pretty little white
apron over her school dress.</p>

<p class='c006'>“To keep my work clean,” said she to Sir
Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Good plan. Now let’s get to work, for
there is plenty to do,” he answered her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took up the handkerchief with
the rolled hem.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll have to overcast around the entire
edge once so you can turn and go back the
other way to finish,” said Sir Bodkin when
the hem was rolled.</p>

<p class='c006'>He called Embroiderer to him and asked
Margaret if she had any fine French embroidery
cotton.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>
<img src='images/i_195.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Mother bought some for me to use,”
she said holding up several skeins in colors
pink, blue, and red.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fine!” cried Sir
Bodkin; “which color
shall you use to work
this edge? You may
use one or two.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think blue and
red would be pretty,”
said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Very good. We’ll
overcast red one way
and blue the other. All ready?” he said to
Embroiderer, when he was harnessed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the Fairy.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then go!” cried the King. Margaret
held the square with the hem at the top, in
her left hand rolled side away from her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Fastening the thread under the rolled hem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>so it couldn’t come out and didn’t show, the
Fairy began to step over and over from right
to left, singing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Over and over from right to left</div>

      <div class='line'>Step over the edge and back ’neath the hem,</div>
      <div class='line'>So fine and even, you know.</div>
      <div class='line'>You keep the hem measured straight by a thread,</div>
      <div class='line'>As you hold it for me to step over.</div>

      <div class='line'>The rolled edge so neatly to cover.”</div>
    </div>

<div class='ic006'>
<p>First overcasting</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“O dear,” said Margaret, “the thread gets
so twisted as he goes over and over.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Let him hang for a minute from the end
and he’ll swing it around straight again,”
laughed Sir Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figleft id010'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
<img src='images/i_197.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>This was done and the overcasting went on.
After a while they were around the four sides
of the handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What shall we do now!”
cried Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Fasten the red thread, take
a blue one, then turn around
and go the other way from left
to right and you’ll see how pretty
it looks,” said the King. The
Fairy sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Over and over from left to right,</div>
      <div class='line'>To cross our first steps we go.</div>
      <div class='line'>Jump over the edge, stick my toe ’neath the hem</div>
      <div class='line'>Where I came through the first time you know.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, doesn’t it look pretty!”
cried Margaret as the tiny crosses began to
appear on the edge.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now leave that and start the third one,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>said Sir Bodkin and Margaret took up the
third square.</p>

<p>Blanket-stitch</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Turn a tiny hem all around, one-eighth
inch both turns, and baste it,” said the King.</p>

<p class='c006'>When this was done, Sir Bodkin told Margaret
of two ways to finish this hem.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You can hem it
with tiny invisible
stitches or you can
blanket-stitch it in
pink,” he said. “Nothing
is more dainty or
charming than a plain
white linen handkerchief finely hemmed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>hand, but for a Christmas present, the pink
blanket-stitching would be more festive,” he
advised.</p>

<p class='c006'>“And I know how to do that, too. I think
these handkerchiefs will all look sweet when
they are finished,” said Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Wash them in the bowl with lukewarm
water and white soap, rinse them, blue them,
and then press them when damp and you’ll
have three first-class presents. Remember to
take your time, make your stitches even, keep
your work clean as you do it, and you’ll come
out all right,” Sir Bodkin said.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret was very busy after school for
several days after this working to finish carefully
and daintily the edges of the three
handkerchiefs. At last all three were done.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Thank you very much, Sir Bodkin, for
showing me how to make such lovely gifts. I
know those who get them will like them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>very much. Thank you all, and a very
Merry Christmas to every one,” she said
smiling as she put each one away carefully in
the needle-book.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_200.jpg' alt='Wrapping up her Christmas gifts' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t eat too much turkey or candy and
don’t forget your little friends,” laughed Sir
Bodkin as he bowed to Margaret from the
table.</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, I’ll try to be wise and I’ll never
forget you!” said she and then she ran away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>and was soon busy wrapping up her Christmas
gifts.</p>

<p class='c006'>Outside the Christmas snow was falling,
inside the little One-Eyed Fairies all prepared
to take a long rest until after the holidays.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>Christmas was over and Margaret’s
little pink fingers were busy again
with a One-Eyed Fairy, sewing on a pretty
square tea-cloth for Mother.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_202.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin saw his little mistress hard at
work and quietly crept up on the table beside
her to find out what she was sewing. He was
very curious and jealous of what she did without
asking him. You see, when a Bodkin and
his subjects come to live in any one’s work-basket
they belong heart and soul to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>person. Especially so if they have been
bought from a store and given for a present.
People sometimes become so fond of their
One-Eyed Fairies, they use them for years and
they become great pets. They miss certain
ones very much when they become lost or
broken.</p>

<p class='c006'>“It’s because we’re made of such finely
tempered steel,” Sir Bodkin once explained to
Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now those are done!” at last exclaimed
Margaret to herself holding up the tea-cloth
stamped with a design of flowers. She had
just finished outlining the leaves and stems
in green embroidery cotton.</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is it, My Lady?” asked Sir Bodkin
unable to control his curiosity any longer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, how do you do?” said Margaret to
him. “Sh-h-h, don’t say a word. I am doing
this for Mother as a surprise. She’s giving a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>tea-party soon and I want to work these
flowers on this tea-cloth. Do you know how
to make them pretty?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_204.jpg' alt='“For Mother as a surprise”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, My Lady,” answered Sir Bodkin,
“they can be done easily and effectively with
lazy-daisies for petals and French knots for
centers.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Those are funny names,” laughed Margaret,
“but you know all about the stitches,
so I’ll take your word for it. What colors
do you think would be nice to work them in?”</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>
<img src='images/i_205.jpg' alt='Lazy-Daisy Stitch' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Everything is color nowadays. You
could use pinks and blues with yellow centers,”
replied the tiny King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That would look
gay, and quite right for
afternoon tea, I think,”
said Margaret, getting
out her embroidery-bag
and selecting the
colors from the French
embroidery cotton in
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Embroiderer was harnessed
with pink for
the first flower.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t forget to
work the petals from
the center all the time,”
Sir Bodkin said to him.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I know, Sire,” he replied and stepped on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the wrong side of the tea-cloth to fasten the
thread underneath the flower center, then he
sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“From the center step out, and a loop I make,</div>
      <div class='line'>At the center step in, and a quick step take</div>
      <div class='line'>Out over the loop end, and step in once more,</div>
      <div class='line'>Then out at the center, make loop as before.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“It goes easier than it sounds,” said Margaret
as she and the Fairy made lazy-daisy
petals of pink, then blue, all along the tea-cloth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“With the yellow centers, it will look very
handsome,” replied Sir Bodkin.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Now for the Frenchies,” laughed Margaret
when all the flower petals were done.
“I wonder what time it’s getting to be.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Just then the big grandfather clock downstairs
in the hall struck five.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’ll have time to start the centers before
it’s time to wash my hands and face and brush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>my hair for dinner. I wish I had the time
with me then I wouldn’t always be running
round looking at clocks,” sighed Margaret.</p>

<p class='c006'>She harnessed Embroiderer with yellow,
and made a knot in one end of the thread as
the King told her to do.</p>

<p class='c006'>“All ready,” said Sir Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_207.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic006'>
<p>French Knots</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, Your Majesty,” answered the Fairy
and stepped up through the cloth from the
wrong side to the right side in the flower
center. Margaret pulled the cotton through,
the knot holding it fast and the Fairy sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c010'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“While you hold me in your right hand,</div>
      <div class='line'>And to left I point my toe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Left hand wraps the cotton round me,</div>
      <div class='line'>Three times where the thread came through.</div>
      <div class='line'>Left hand holds the wrapped thread firmly,</div>
      <div class='line'>In again I stick my toe,</div>
      <div class='line'>Through the place where I came out first</div>
      <div class='line'>To the wrong side quickly then I go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>After the embroidery cotton had been
pulled all the way through, it left a little
round knot on the right side in the flower
center. Sir Bodkin told Margaret to bring
the fairy up through again to make another
French knot in the flower center.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Five knots are about right for one
flower,” said he. So Margaret and the fairy
Embroiderer made that number in each one.</p>

<p class='c006'>“You have to hold the cotton tight with
your left hand as you push him in, or it
doesn’t make a pretty knot, does it?” said
Margaret after a while.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes, you have to get the knack, as you do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>in almost any kind of stitchery,” remarked
Sir Bodkin.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/i_209.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I must stop now and get ready for
dinner!” cried Margaret jumping up and
sticking Embroiderer into
the pincushion so deep that
nothing could be seen of
him at all. Then she ran
hurriedly out of the room
after putting her work away
in her bureau drawer.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Goodness me, where am I?” cried the
Fairy in alarm. “I’ve sunk out of sight, I
know!” But none of the others heard him,
for his voice was smothered in the sawdust
stuffing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>“Where did you last see him, My Lady?”
asked Sir Bodkin in distress. He, too, had
been looking everywhere; in the needle-book
and the work-basket and on the table-top, for
the lost One-Eyed Fairy. This was the first
time during the year they had lived with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Margaret that anything had happened to
any one of them.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, I remember now where I left him
yesterday!” cried Margaret. “I was in a
hurry and stuck him ’way down deep into the
pincushion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Then you’ll have to squeeze him out,”
said Sir Bodkin. “Take the pincushion and
squeeze the top and bottom together carefully,
so if he’s there his toe won’t prick your
fingers. Many a One-Eyed Fairy has been
lost in a pincushion.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret took
up the red tomato
pincushion and
squeezed it and
pinched it.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Here he is!”
she cried as Embroiderer’s head began to
poke through the top of the red cloth.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>“Deary me, but I’m glad to get out of that
place again!” said he taking a deep breath.
“You can’t breathe in there and the sawdust
gets in your eye, too. I squirmed and
wriggled and perhaps I’d have come out the
bottom soon. My, but I’m glad you squeezed
me out the top!”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Of course you might have got yourself
out, but we should have been frightfully
worried,” said Sir Bodkin much relieved to
see him again safe and sound.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you feel like helping me to do the
rest of these French knots in the tea-cloth?”
asked Margaret, putting him through the
emery to dust off the sawdust.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, yes! Some exercise would do me
good,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret and he worked busily and finished
the tea-cloth.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Do you know that to-morrow will be my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>birthday?” asked the little girl of the One-Eyed
Fairies and their King.</p>

<p class='c006'>“So it will,” replied Sir Bodkin. “It
doesn’t seem a year since we came to live
with you, My Lady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“No, the time has gone very fast for me.
It’s been lots of fun knowing you all and
learning how to sew and make pretty things,”
said Margaret looking at her tiny friends with
shining eyes.</p>

<p class='c006'>“We’ll always stick to you, My Lady,”
they all cried.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I’m glad, for I never could do without
you. Oh, there goes that clock striking half-past
five! It’s late. I must hurry to tidy
myself before Father comes home to dinner.
Good-bye, dears,” she said running out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c006'>Next morning early Sir Bodkin and the
One-Eyes were wakened out of their sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>by a loud noise in their work-basket
home.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Tick-tick,” it sounded.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mercy sakes!” cried Sir Bodkin hopping
up very much frightened. “I never heard
such a queer noise in my life!”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_214.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>Every one of the One-Eyed Fairies was
frightened, too. There in the work-basket
among the sewing things was a long blue box.
The noise was coming from inside.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Maybe it’s a bomb!” cried Baster who
had a vivid imagination.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>“It’s something terrible, I know!” said
Hemmer timidly.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I think we’re all wrong!” said Sir Bodkin
suddenly. “This is Margaret’s birthday and
I believe this is for her, ’cause it looks something
like a jewel-box to me and——”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/i_215.jpg' alt='“A silver wrist-watch for my birthday!”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the matter? What are you all
looking at so intently!” cried Margaret
herself just then as she jumped out of bed and
ran over to see.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Oh, look!” she cried in delight, picking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>up the blue leather box and pressing the
spring-button in the front. The lid flew up
and the cause of all the disturbance lay there,
before their eyes, ticking away on the white
satin lining.</p>

<p class='c006'>“A silver wrist-watch for my birthday!”
gasped Margaret with her eyes growing
bigger and bigger with surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sir Bodkin and all the One-Eyed Fairies
fell back in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Many, many happy returns of the day,
My Lady!” said the King, bowing and
bending.</p>

<p class='c006'>“That’s just what it says on this card,”
cried Margaret and read aloud:</p>
